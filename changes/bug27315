  o Minor bugfixes (linux seccomp2 sandbox):
    - Fix a regression on sandboxing rules for the openat() syscall.
      The fix for bug 25440 fixed the problem on some systems but broke 
      tor on other systems. We now reintroduce the openat rule that 
      existed prior to the 25440 fix (and keep new rule) to make tor 
      work again on affected systems. Patch from Daniel Pinto.
